# Portfolio website Milestone Project

Welcome to my Portfolio website!

This website was built as part of the learning material for Code Institute's Fullstack Web Developer program.

## Project Description

This site was created in order to get familiar with common development tools like gitpod, Git & GitHub, and how to use them to write and manage code. The project itself will display a breakdown of the technologies used in each of the different sections of the program

## UX

The first impression upon visiting the website should be focussed on my portfolio. The landing page straight away shows the qualifications & introduction to capture the interest of potential partners.

## Features

The website offers a contact form(not yet functional due to lack of server backend) to get in contact. On the bottom relevant social media & github links are available.

Features to implement
- Working contact form
- page&links directly to other projects

## Technology

This project was written in HTML & CSS using Gitpod.

#Technologies Used
In this project we used some simple HTML5 and CSS3 supported by Bootstrap 4 to build the project, we wrote our code using Gitpod Workspaces and we've backed it up using Git and GitHub.

## Testing

Using Chrome Developer tools I checked the website display on different screen sizes to assure a mobile-first design. All links & pages have been checked for valid pictures&links.

## Deployment

This website is deployes using Github pages https://nataloska.github.io/Portfolio/index.html.

## Credits

While working on this project I regularly checked Bootstrap for examples how to implement their features.
